# Landing Page Template

# Description

I created a landing page template for a fake outdoors company. The idea was to get a feel for how to design a simple landing page. I found some examples online to help come up with a design of my own. The styling and theme is entirely custom. I used a few icons from font-awesome, added keyframe animations and used custom css styling.
